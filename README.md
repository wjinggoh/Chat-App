but i change the UI myself and have some additional thoughts added to this simple application


# Tools: Firebase, Flutter
# Modules:
# Register, Login, Logout, Settings, Chat, User List, dark/light theme
## i have currently done all these functions above


## my additional functions to be done: user profile, user add picture to chat, help function, emojis
